          This project analyzes Manhattan traffic accident data from 2019 and
          2020 to uncover spatial and temporal patterns using clustering and
          exploratory techniques. We applied DBSCAN for hotspot detection and
          compared accident trends before and during the pandemic. The focus was
          on data cleaning, preprocessing, and extracting insights for urban
          planning and safety improvements.

          This project leveraged a comprehensive dataset of New York City
          traffic accidents, focusing exclusively on the Manhattan borough to
          deliver targeted insights. The raw data required extensive cleaning
          due to numerous missing values and redundant columns, such as combined
          location data and separate injury/fatality counts, which were
          consolidated for clarity.

              Clustering with DBSCAN revealed a stark shift in accident hotspots
              between 2019 and 2020. In 2019, clusters concentrated around
              tourist destinations like Hudson Yards (The Vessel, The Edge)
              indicated heavy footfall and travel activity. However, in 2020,
              post-lockdown, accident density increased in residential and
              restaurant-heavy areas like Lexington Avenue — a trend likely
              driven by increased food delivery traffic during stay-at-home
              periods.

              Analysis of accident data by hour reveals a notable spike around 3
              PM. This peak likely corresponds to increased traffic during lunch
              hours, when many people are on the road after eating and may
              experience drowsiness. Additionally, this time coincides with a
              surge in food delivery activities, which contributes to higher
              vehicle density and, consequently, more accidents. Understanding
              this pattern helps identify critical time windows for traffic

              Examining accidents across days of the week shows that Fridays
              consistently experience the highest number of collisions. This
              increase can be attributed to end-of-week rushes, social events,
              and gatherings that contribute to heavier traffic volumes and
              potentially riskier driving behavior. Recognizing this weekly

              This project uncovered meaningful patterns in Manhattan’s traffic
              accident data, highlighting key temporal peaks around 3 PM and
              Fridays, driven by lunch hour traffic and end-of-week activity.
              Spatial analysis revealed shifts in accident hotspots from tourist
              areas in 2019 to more residential and delivery-focused zones in
              2020, reflecting behavioral changes during COVID-19 lockdowns.
              Leveraging DBSCAN for spatial clustering and careful data
              preprocessing enabled these actionable insights. These findings
              not only demonstrate strong data science skills but also provide
              valuable information that can help guide urban planning and
              traffic safety improvements in Manhattan.
